## Hello!
**This app has two main purposes:**
 * To outline best practices for R shiny development
 * To function as a database for frequently used modules
  * Send them to @BarrettK if you think others could benefit from modules you've made!


## Best Practices

This includes a proper file stucture and working directory setup, as well as techniques Metrum is striving to make a standard for R shiny development projects
  - use modules where warranted
    - talk about when and why to use them. 
    - Metrum's goal
  - Testing
    - shinytest
    - testserver() (shiny package)
    - testthat for non-reactive objects
  - More?

**To do:**
* logrrr and confic
* Good practices (this page)
* add/create modules commonly used at Metrum
* Get feedback on clarity and other info that could be helpful to include
* ...more?
